        <h1>I LOVE chips</h1>
        <p>I love chips. I think they are so delicios and crunchy and perfect. Did you know that they were invented on accident! After a customer at George Crum's resterant complained about the thickness of his fries. Leading to George slicing the potatoes to be papaer thin and the serving them. Now we have hundereds of flavors and brands!</p>
