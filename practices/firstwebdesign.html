        <h1>Nail design</h1>
        <p>Nail design is one of my best skills and I enjoy doing it a lot. It makes me happy that I am so skilled and good at it. I have a crazy amount of supplies and I like that it is completly customizable. I am able to express my creativity through nail art.</p>
        <h2>How to gain the skill!</h2>
        <p>It may feel discouraging after trying this skill and not getting the output you wanted but that is okay! When I mstarted I was not good but after like a year of practice and a steady hand i was able to make some amazing things. I have a plethera of brushes, polishes, tools, and other detailing things. Sometimes I use insperation pictures but other times I just make them up on my own with my own creativity!</p>
