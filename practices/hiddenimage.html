        <p>I love cats. I think they are adorable and so cute. I have a cat of my own named Sunny. 
        She is fat and mean and orange but I still love her.(the picture is not her but kinda looks like
         her</p>

        <p>We got my cat about 9 years ago from m aunt and uncle who got her from their grandparents who
             found her in their chicken coop eating the chickens eggs. Kind of a long twisted story but
            now we have her and she is quite old now but we still kove her no matter what. These are the
             reasons I love her</p>

            <ol>
                <li>she is very cute</li>
                <li>she might cuddle with you if youre lucky</li>
                <li>she kinda likes me</li>
            </ol>
