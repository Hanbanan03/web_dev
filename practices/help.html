        <h1>Nail design</h1>
        <p>Nail design is one of my best skills and I enjoy 
            doing it a lot. It makes me happy that I am so 
            skilled and good at it. I have a crazy amount of 
            supplies and I like that it is completly customizable. 
            I am able to express my creativity through nail art.</p> 
        <h2>How to gain the skill!</h2>
        <p>It may feel discouraging after trying this skill and not
             getting the output you wanted but that is okay! When I
              started I was not good but after like a year of 
              practice and a steady hand i was able to make some 
              amazing things. I have a plethera of brushes, polishes, 
              tools, and other detailing things. Sometimes I use 
              insperation pictures but other times I just make them up 
              on my own with my own creativity!</p>
